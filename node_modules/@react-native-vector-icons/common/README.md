  * [FontAwesome 6 Pro](packages/fontawesome6-pro/README.md)
  * [Fontello](packages/fontello/README.md)

### iOS Setup

To use the bundled icons on iOS, follow these steps:

1. Update your pods
  ```sh
  cd ios && pod update
  ```

### macOS Setup

TBA: It should just work???

### Windows Setup

TBA: It should just work???

### Web Setup

FIXME: Can we improve on this?

To integrate the library with your web project using [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), follow these steps:

1.  In your webpack configuration file, add a section to handle TTF files using `url-loader` or `file-loader`:

    ```js
    {
      test: /\.ttf$/,
      loader: "url-loader", // or directly file-loader
      include: path.resolve(__dirname, "node_modules/react-native-vector-icons"),
    }
    ```

2.  In your JavaScript entry point, consume the font files and inject the necessary style tag:

        ```js
          import Icon from '@react-native-vector-icons/fontAwesome';

          // Generate the required CSS
          import iconFont from '@react-native-vector-icons/fontawesome/fonts/FontAwesome.ttf';
          const iconFontStyles = `@font-face {
            src: url(${iconFont});
            font-family: FontAwesome;
          }`;

          // Create a stylesheet
          const style = document.createElement('style');
          style.type = 'text/css';

          // Append the iconFontStyles to the stylesheet
          if (style.styleSheet) {
            style.styleSheet.cssText = iconFontStyles;
          } else {
            style.appendChild(document.createTextNode(iconFontStyles));
          }

          // Inject the stylesheet into the document head
          document.head.appendChild(style);
          ```

    By following these steps, you will seamlessly integrate the vector icons
    library into your web project using [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/),
    enabling you to effortlessly use the icons within your web application.

## `Icon` Component

You can either use one of the bundled icons above or roll your own custom font.

```js
import Icon from '@react-native-vector-icons/fontawesome';
const myIcon = <Icon name="rocket" size={30} color="#900" />;
```

### Properties

Any [Text property](https://reactnative.dev/docs/text.html) and the following:

| Prop        | Description                                                             | Default     |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| **`size`**  | Size of the icon, can also be passed as `fontSize` in the style object. | `12`        |
| **`name`**  | What icon to show, see Icon Explorer app or one of the links above.     | _None_      |
| **`color`** | Color of the icon.                                                      | _Inherited_ |

### Static Methods

| Prop                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`getImageSource`**     | Returns a promise that resolving to the source of a bitmap version of the icon for use with `Image` component et al. Usage: `const source = await Icon.getImageSource(name, size, color)` |
| **`getImageSourceSync`** | Same as `getImageSource` but synchronous. Usage: `const source = Icon.getImageSourceSync(name, size, color)`                                                                              |

### Styling

Since `Icon` builds on top of the `Text` component, most [style properties](https://reactnative.dev/docs/style.html) will work as expected, you might find it useful to play around with these:

- `backgroundColor`
- `borderWidth`
- `borderColor`
- `borderRadius`
- `padding`
- `margin`
- `color`
- `fontSize`

By combining some of these you can create for example :

![type](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/378279/7667570/33817554-fc0d-11e4-9ad7-4eb60139cfb7.png)
![star](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/378279/7667569/3010dd7e-fc0d-11e4-9696-cb721fe8e98d.png)

## Usage as PNG Image/Source Object

Convenient way to plug this in into other components that rely on bitmap images rather than scalable vector icons. Takes the arguments `name`, `size` and `color` as described above.

```jsx
const source = Icon.getImageSourceSync('user', 20, 'red');
return <Image source={source} />;
);
```

Alternatively you may use the async method `Icon.getImageSource`.

Keep in mind that `Icon.getImageSourceSync` is blocking and might incur performance penalties. Subsequent calls will use cache however.

## Multi-Style Fonts

Some fonts today use multiple styles, FontAwesome 5 for example, which is supported by this library. The usage is pretty much the same as the standard `Icon` component:

```jsx
import Icon from '@react-native-vector-icons/fontawesome5';

const myIcon1 = <Icon name="comments" size={30} color="#900" />; // Defaults to solid
const myIcon2 = <Icon name="comments" size={30} color="#900" iconType="solid" />;
const myIcon3 = <Icon name="comments" size={30} color="#900" iconType="light" />; // Only in FA5 Pro
```

### Static methods

All static methods from `Icon` is supported by multi-styled fonts.

| Prop                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`getImageSource`**     | Returns a promise that resolving to the source of a bitmap version of the icon for use with `Image` component et al. Usage: `const source = await Icon.getImageSource(name, size, color)` |
| **`getImageSourceSync`** | Same as `getImageSource` but synchronous. Usage: `const source = Icon.getImageSourceSync(name, size, color)`                                                                              |

## Custom Fonts

The best approach is to use our icon generator to create your own icon package.

See [CREATE_FONT_PACKAGE.md] to learn how to create your own font packages.

You can also use `createIconSet(glyphMap, fontFamily[, fontFile])` directly in your project. This
returns your own custom font based on the `glyphMap` where the key is the icon
name and the value is either a UTF-8 character or it's character code.
`fontFamily` is the name of the postscript font **NOT** the filename. Open the font in
Font Book.app or similar to learn the name. Optionally pass the third
`fontFile` argument for android support, it should be the custom font file
name.

```js
import { createIconSet } from '@react-native-vector-icons/common';
const glyphMap = { 'icon-name': 1234, test: '∆' };
const Icon = createIconSet(glyphMap, 'FontName', 'font-name.ttf');
```

You should place the font ttf file into `rnvi-fonts`. You can customise this location by adding the following snippet to your package.json
```json
{
  "reactNativeVectorIcons": {
    "fontDir": "src/assets/fonts"
  }
}
  ```

## Animation

React Native comes with an amazing animation library called
[`Animated`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/animated.html). To use it with an
icon, simply create an animated component with this line: `const AnimatedIcon =
Animated.createAnimatedComponent(Icon)`. You can also use the higher level
animation library
[react-native-animatable](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-animatable).

## Usage Examples

### IconExplorer

Try the `IconExplorer` project in `Examples/IconExplorer` folder, there you can also search for any icon.

![Screenshot of IconExplorer](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/378279/8903470/a9fe6b46-3458-11e5-901f-98b7b676d0d3.png)

### Basic Example

```js
import Icon from '@react-native-vector-icons/ionicons';

function ExampleView(props) {
  return <Icon name="ios-person" size={30} color="#4F8EF7" />;
}
```

### Inline Icons

```js
import { Text } from 'react-native';
import Icon from '@react-native-vector-icons/ionicons';

function ExampleView(props) {
  return (
    <Text>
      Lorem <Icon name="ios-book" color="#4F8EF7" /> Ipsum
    </Text>
  );
}
```
